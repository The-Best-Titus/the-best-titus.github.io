I’m Titus, a **freshman Computer Engineering student** with a passion for hands-on tech. I enjoy building server labs, working with microcontrollers, and designing responsive web interfaces. My projects blend hardware and software to solve real-world problems. I’m always **learning new tools and frameworks** to expand my skills. This site is where I share my journey and showcase what I’m building.
