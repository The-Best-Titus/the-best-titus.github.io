# Welcome to My Blog!

Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my stuff that maybe 5 people will see!

## What to Expect

In this blog, you can expect:

- **Blog Posts** mostly about Technology
- **Reviews** Movies, Albums, Tv Shows, Stuff I get/buy
- **Playlist** A good way to find hear the music I like
- **thoughts** Whatever I want published, could be about Religion, world around us, or even clash royal.

🖼️📷 Pictures used in blog *(if attribute not given)* are taken/made by me.

## About Me

I am a person. WOW! Honestly if you are reading this you probably know me or maybe are looking at hiring me, in which case I would think you have read a bunch of about me already. Or you can just reread the one on my main page.

## Send me an email I am lonely

If you have some thoughts you want me to know email me at titus.maunu@gmail.com

Thanks for stopping by!

##### P.S. 

I have experience with hacking so if you are emailing me because I said I am lonely I will automatically think you are trying to exploit my user access and will prob delete/block your email. Thanks anyways!
